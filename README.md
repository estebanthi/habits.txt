## Features

- [x] Track habits in a plain text file
- [x] Track boolean (done/not done) habits or measurable habits/metrics (e.g. weight)
- [x] Custom and complex frequencies for habits (daily, on Monday and Friday, on the 1st every month, etc...)
- [x] Get stats about your habits with the CLI or with charts opening in your browser

## Installation

```bash
pip install habits.txt
```

You can then use the CLI with:

```bash
hbtxt --help
```

Alternatively, you can use the executable provided by the latest release.

## Concepts

### Time-bound

A habit is time-bound. It has a start date, and eventually an end date.
It means with habits.txt, you can track habits for a specific period of time. When you want to stop tracking a habit, you can just stop tracking it.

### Frequency

A habit is defined by a frequency, else it's called a task. The minimum frequency supported by habits.txt is daily (it doesn't support intra-day habits).

### Boolean or Measurable

A habit can be boolean or measurable. A boolean habit is either done or not done. A measurable habit has a value.

## Format

Habits are tracked in what I call a "journal" which is just a plain text file. A journal contains "directives".

A directive is composed of a date, a directive type, a habit name, and other metadata specific to the directive type. For example, here is a sample directive:

```
2024-01-01 track "Read 5 pages a day" (* * *)
```

You can comment lines in your journal by starting them with a `#` character.
You can't add comments at the end of a line.

```
# Start tracking a habit
2024-01-01 track "Read 5 pages a day" (* * *)
```

## Directives

### track

To start tracking a habit, you use the `track` directive and specify the frequency of the habit enclosed in parentheses.
Optionally, you can make the habit measurable by specifying the "measurable" keyword.

The frequency follows a simplified [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) syntax, omitting the minute and the hour.

Example:

```
2024-01-01 track "Read 5 pages a day" (* * *)
2024-01-01 track "Exercise" (* * 1,3,5) measurable
```

### untrack

To stop tracking a habit, you use the `untrack` directive.

Example:

```
2024-02-01 untrack "Read 5 pages a day"
```

### record

To record a habit, you use the `record` directive and specify a value.

The allowed values are `yes`, `no`, or a number. You should not mix boolean and numeric values for the same habit.

You can write directives but omit the directive type, it will default to `record` (as it is supposed to be the most common directive).

Example:

```
2024-01-01 record "Read 5 pages a day" 5
2024-01-01 record "Workout" yes
2024-01-01 "Weight" 70.5
```

## Examples

`habits.journal`:

```txt
2024-01-01 track "Reading" (* * *)
2024-01-01 track "Exercise" (* * 1,3,5)
2024-01-01 track "Weight" (* * 1) measurable

# Record habits
2024-01-01 record "Reading" yes
2024-01-01 record "Exercise" no
2024-01-01 record "Weight" 70.5
```

Once your journal is ready, you can use the CLI to interact with it.

```bash
# Set the journal file as default journal
hbtxt config set journal /path/to/habits.journal

# Fill the habits for today interactively
hbtxt fill -i
Exercise (2024-01-01): yes

# Filter habit records
hbtxt filter -n "Exercise"
2024-01-01 Exercise yes

# Get information about the other available commands
hbtxt --help

# Get information about a given command
hbtxt chart --help

# Get information about the available config options
hbtxt config set --help
```
